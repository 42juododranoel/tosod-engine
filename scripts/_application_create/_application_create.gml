	// 
	// Store is something you use to render everything on screen each frame.
	// You also save and load your game by saving and loading store.
	// Cache works the same way store does, but is 1) restorable and 2) non-serializable.
	// 1) Restorable means that it's OK to lose cache if something happens.
	// 2) Non-serializable means that you can store grid, object and other things in cache,
	// because the store is not being saved or loaded, it simply keeps things in memory.
	// Idmap is a mapping between logical ids and runtime ids.
	// All stores got purged before each test.
