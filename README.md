# TOSOD Game Engine

This is a game engine made by me on top of GameMaker Studios. It powers my top-down pixel RPG, which will be released later.

What's inside:
- [x] Django-like apps structure
- [x] Pytest-inspired testing framework
- [ ] Nuxt-inspired store, mutations and rendering
- [ ] Menu app - start/exit your game
- [ ] Game app - manage plot progress and NPCs
- [ ] Location app - render locations
- [ ] Entity app - commandable objects
- [ ] ...
