# TOSOD Game Engine

TOSOD engine is a game engine made by me on top of the GameMaker Studio. It powers my top-down pixel RPG, which will be released later.

What's inside:
- [x] Django-like apps structure
- [x] Pytest-inspired testing framework with paramerizing
- [x] Nuxt-inspired store, mutations and rendering
- ...

## Documentation

### General Rules

1. Everything which is displayed at every frame on screen should be declaratively described with three types of storages: store, cache and idmap. It is prohibited to render any piece of code which is not saved in either store, cache or idmap.
2. Every change to the store, cache or idmap should not happen on the fly and should be instead represented as a query. 
3. Any piece of code should be tied to a specific isolated app (application, game, menu, entity, location, slideshow, dialog, order). Every app should be generally similar to the others in terms of structure (store, cache, idmap, start, stop, testsuits, fixtures)
4. No controlling objects as instances allowed on instance layers. Controlling objects should be in-memory, so that they would not have to be carried from one layer to another and managed. Only entity instances should be present on instance layers.
5. It is prohibited to keep in store anything which cannot be serialized, but it is allowed to keep unserializable data structures in cache and idmap, given that they are used more than once.


### To Do

- [x] django app structure
- [x] tests inside testsuits inside apps
- [x] pytest parametrizing
- [x] store, cache, idmap creation
- [ ] pytest fixtures in tosotest
- [ ] switching rooms in tosotest
- [ ] split App into App and Component (SingletonComponent/InstanceComponent)
